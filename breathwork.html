            <h3 class="quote silver-text">What is breath, this powerful medicine of oxygen?</h3>
            <p>Breath is the carrier wave of life itself, the bridge between spirit and matter, and the chariot of the soul. It is a dazzling derivative of the rich, pranic energies which swirl, spiral, dance and undulate all around us. It is also an ancient (inner) technology which has been largely hidden for eons… As the conscious engagement of breath is a multidimensional art form which holds some of the the most powerful mysteries known to humanity… </p>

            <p>The masters of the East knew that conscious breath was the secret to unlocking the highest states of consciousness, creativity and embodiment— for we were always meant to live in ecstatic vibrance and unbounded “I Am” presence, connected to ourselves, each other, the divine and all that is. However, due to its power, this type of breath was kept secret for eons and passed down only through closed lineages of initiation. It is only now, at a pivotal time in human history, that we begin to proliferate this hidden knowledge of the ancients back into the world, in order to assist the collective in healing from generations of trauma and conditioning and also to awaken our greater dormant potential. </p>

            <p>Conscious Connected Breathwork is considered to be one of the most advanced techniques of self-mastery on the path to embodied ascension, and a straight-arrow path to spiritual metamorphosis… </p>

            <p>What does this mean, you might wonder? Whereas some individuals get lost in their healing work- taking years, decades or lifetime(s) to isolate the root of their core wounds, traumatic imprints, emotional blockages and perceptual distortions (aspects that continue to influence them in the now and prevent their higher potential from being unlocked), breathwork will gracefully cut through the layers of resistance, armoring and untruth, putting one into direct contact with the source code of what lives within them for profound transformation. </p>

            <p>The secret of secrets? </p>

            <p>The only way out is through. </p>

            <p>In order to release that which holds us back from actualizing our higher potential, purpose and genius, we must first intimately and lovingly meet these contracted textures, connect to and commune with them, hold them, deeply be with them, tend to them, honor them, and finally integrate their wisdom before we may set them free. </p>
