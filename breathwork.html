            <h3 class="quote silver-text">What is breath, this powerful medicine of oxygen?</h3>
            <p>The Sacred Breath Method is a gateway to non-ordinary states of consciousness where profound healing and transformative experiences can occur. Through the unfathomable intelligence of breath (or spirit), the breather is guided on a personal journey into their being (or soul) through a safe and intentional container. The SBM rebalances the emotional body, heals the pain body and activates one’s higher soul expression. It allows one to access higher states of awareness, spiritual wisdom, and emotional breakthroughs (catharsis) through a somatic pilgrimage (or journey) into self. Many who have worked this method of breathwork say it is the next caliber of transpersonal healing and find it to be completely life-changing.</p>
            
            <p>Breath is the carrier wave of life itself, the bridge between spirit and matter, and the chariot of the soul. It is a dazzling derivative of the rich, pranic energies which swirl, spiral, dance and undulate all around us. It is also an ancient (inner) technology which has been largely hidden for eons… As the conscious engagement of breath is a multidimensional art form which holds some of the the most powerful mysteries known to humanity… </p>

            <p>The masters of the East knew that conscious breath was the secret to unlocking the highest states of consciousness, creativity and embodiment— for we were always meant to live in ecstatic vibrance and unbounded “I Am” presence, connected to ourselves, each other, the divine and all that is. However, due to its power, this type of breath was kept secret for eons and passed down only through closed lineages of initiation. It is only now, at a pivotal time in human history, that we begin to proliferate this hidden knowledge of the ancients back into the world, in order to assist the collective in healing from generations of trauma and conditioning and also to awaken our greater dormant potential. </p>

            <p>The only way out is through. </p>

            <p>In order to release that which holds us back from actualizing our higher potential, purpose and genius, we must first intimately and lovingly meet these contracted textures, connect to and commune with them, hold them, deeply be with them, tend to them, honor them, and finally integrate their wisdom before we may set them free. </p>

            
Breathing deeply and circularly not only brings vital levels of oxygen into the body, but it is also a practice of aligning to universal life-force energy so that it may move through you. Breathwork is a powerful tool for dissolving energetic blockages, surfacing emotional wounds for greater healing and catharisis, activating the higher mind for multi-faceted clarity, and allowing the breather to enter into transcendental and mystical states of consciousness by way of the theta (or occasionally delta) brainwave.

            Somatic unwinding/experiencing and trauma release/resolution through breathwork can:

- Reestablish safety in and with the body

- Allow breathers to moving from freeze to freedom and regain choice

- Resolve anxiety in the nervous system

- Lead to the development of emotional mastery

- Support soul retrieval (reclamation of the lost parts of self)
