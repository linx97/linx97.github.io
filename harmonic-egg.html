            The day after my session in the egg, I felt deeply calm. Everything seemed to slow down a bit, but in a peaceful way. I felt waves of heart opening and intense gratitude. Nothing specific had changed in my life, while all had become more beautiful. It’s hard to put into words exactly what my session did, but something certainly happened. Very lovely and powerful. I look forward to my next session. <strong>- Kelley</strong></p>

            I’m crying writing this. Saying thank you isn’t enough for how grateful I am. Kerrin, she literally has so much more energy. I’m not sure what that machine has done for her, but we went to church last night and without me even saying anything, people noticed how much more alert, happy and bouncy she was. It’s like she’s not bogged down anymore. My momma heart is so happy. Big, big hugs…            (about her 4 year old daughter's session) <strong>- Mandi R</strong></p>

            The Harmonic Egg is life changing! I had 6 sessions earlier this year, and the results were amazing: clearer & calmer mind and more energy! My mom also had 2 sessions and she was able to shed a lot of negative energy from her childhood. I can’t recommend the Harmonic Egg enough – 10 stars! <strong>- Mia Voss</strong></p>

            I had a session in the Harmonic Egg targeted to reduce inflammation after sinus and nose surgery. I went into the session so congested I could barely talk, but by early evening my sinuses suddenly cleared., so that I’m able to breathe through my nose for the first time in two weeks.<strong>- Linda B</strong></p>

                          <p>A session is 50 minutes long, 40 minutes of music and light, and 10 minutes of silence. The silence is used to integrate the therapeutic sound and light and their healing effects. Why is this necessary? We offer the analogy of eating a 3 course dinner. We wouldn’t think of eating a second 3 course meal immediately following the first. Instead, we would need time to digest the meal, allowing the body to extract the wonderful nutrients and put them into action. We are likely to be hungry again the next day after this “integration” period. Energy work is much the same; you must let one modality digest before you “feed” it more. This effect has also been documented by many notable sound healers. The complete integration time is usually about 3 to 5 days. This is the amount of time recommended between Harmonic Egg sessions.</p>

                          <p>Plan to dress comfortably when visiting the Harmonic Egg. We also ask you to refrain from wearing any colognes or perfumes. All metal, including jewelry must be removed for the session. Pacemakers and implanted metal devices are fine and will not be affected.</p>

                      <div>
                          <p>It is best to approach a session without expectations as each person is unique and so is their experience. However a HE session is very powerful. It uses 5 modalities in one - frequency, vibration, sound and light waves and the resonant frequency (the enclosed area within the shape of an egg). If you are sensitive to energy you may feel a change. Even if you don’t, subtle changes are happening within the body as the technology is designed to provide optimal relaxation and autonomic balance. A Harmonic Egg session helps the body perform the healing it was innately born to do!</p>
                          <p>Here are a few of the most common experiences:</p>
                          <p><strong>Feeling a surge of energy following a session-</strong> Treatments raise vibrational frequency offering a vital boost to the cells, organs and tissues. If this is your experience it’s important not to overexert yourself even if you feel more energetic than normal. Following a session, we alway recommend  that you approach exercise and physical work conservatively, if possible. This allows you to save your energy for healing. After the initial boost of energy you may feel a gradual fatigue. Don’t be concerned, this may indicate your cells are using the energy to release toxins and heal.</p>
                          <p><strong>Feeling little difference-</strong> This is not uncommon initially, as each person’s sensitivity levels to energy differs. Beneficial changes are taking place in the background whether you can feel it or not. It may take a few days for you to sense a difference, or if you are working on a health challenge, a series of visits may be required before you feel any change. The changes experienced vary greatly from client to client and are often governed by their body’s specific requirements.</p>
                          <p><strong>Feeling exhausted or fatigued–</strong> This is a common aspect of the healing process. During this time we encourage you to control what outside factors you can, to offer extra healing support for the body. Get a little extra sleep, drink plenty of water, eat a healthy diet, try to relax more often. If you develop brain fog (fuzzy thinking), this may be from a release of toxins. You can assist the process along by drinking plenty of filtered or spring water, and by adding electrolytes.</p>

                      <div>
                          <p>In our experience, a person gains the most benefit when a series of sessions are grouped together. Although people feel relaxed and soothed following a single session in the Harmonic Egg, to achieve maximum effect, a person is encouraged to schedule multiple sessions. For someone who is looking to deal with the mental/physical effects of mild to moderate stress that might be 3 to 4 sessions, while someone who is dealing with a chronic health condition, may choose 8 or 10 sessions. Prepaid discounted packages are available.</p>
